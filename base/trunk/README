* Install

  $ tar xzvf rclm2-x.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd rclm2-x.x.x
  $ ./configure [--prefix=<RCLMDIR>]
  $ make
  [ $ su ]
  $ make install

The main command 'rclm2' is installed into 'RCLMDIR/bin'. Several sub
script files are also installed into 'RCLMDIR/share/rclm2'


* Usage

  + Create round directory

   The sub script files are copied (or sym-linked) in ROUND directory
   (The default setting is 'sym-link').

     $ rclm2 [ -c | -s ] <ROUND>

  + Change directory to the ROUND

     $ cd <ROUND>

  + Set league type

     $ ./script/init { SSIL2D | competition | robocup2007_2D  }

  + (Optional) Set scheduler type

  If you do not set the scheduler type, the roundrobin scheduler is
  used by default.

     $ ./script/init_scheduler [ roundrobin | tournament ]

  + Create schedule file

  TEAMS is the team listed file, and './var/schedule' is the match
  listed file. The detailed format  is described in the following
  sections.

     $ ./script/schedule/init <TEAMS>
     (or, directly create/edit './var/schedule'.)

  + Start games

  It is strongly recommended to check the schedule file before you
  start the round.

     $ cat ./var/schedule
     $ ./script/start


* Format of team list file

Each line contains only one team.
PATH_TO_TEAM? is the team directory where their start or kill
scripts exist. This value is usually the home directory of each team.
'''NOTE''': PATH_TO_TEAM? must not contain the white space.

 <PATH_TO_TEAM1>
 <PATH_TO_TEAM2>
 <PATH_TO_TEAM3>
 ...

Example:
 /home/wright2d
 /home/ath
 /home/oxsy
 /home/brasil2d


* Format of schedule file

Each line contains only one match.
PATH_TO_TEAM? must be same as the string value listed in the team list
file.
 <PATH_TO_TEAM1> vs <PATH_TO_TEAM2> [<START_TIME>]
 <PATH_TO_TEAM2> vs <PATH_TO_TEAM3> [<START_TIME>]
 ...

START_TIME is an optional value, that indicates the time when that
game will be started.
START_TIME is not automatically generated. So, you need to write
them by yourself.


Example:
 /home/wright2d vs /home/ath 11:30
 /home/ath vs /home/oxsy 11:45
 /home/oxsy vs /home/brasil2d 12:00
 /home/wright2d vs /home/brasil2d 12:15
 /home/wright2d vs /home/oxsy 12:30
 /home/ath vs /home/brasil2d 12:45


* Example: SSIL settings

At first, you must prepare the team listed file, called 'teams.all'.

    $ rclm2 SSIL
    $ cd SSIL
    $ ./script/init SSIL2D
    $ ./script/schedule/init teams.all
    $ cat ./var/schedule
    $ ./script/start
